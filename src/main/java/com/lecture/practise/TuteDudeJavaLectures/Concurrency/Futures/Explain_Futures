What‚Äôs a Future?

Think of ordering a pizza üçï:

- You place the order (start a task).
- You get a token/receipt that represents your order (this is the Future).
- You can do other stuff while it‚Äôs baking.
- Later, you use the token to get the pizza when it‚Äôs ready.

In Java, a Future<T> is that token for a computation that‚Äôs running on another thread and will eventually
produce a result of type T.

Why do we need it?

- To run slow work (like network calls, file I/O, heavy CPU tasks) without freezing your main thread.
- To check if work is done, wait for it, or cancel it.


The basic players

- ExecutorService: a thread pool (group of worker threads).
- Callable<T>: a task that returns a value T (like a function).
- Future<T>: the handle you get back when you submit a Callable.


The modern way: CompletableFuture (nicer API)

Future is basic and mostly blocking (you call get() and wait).
CompletableFuture lets you chain tasks and react when they finish‚Äîless blocking, cleaner async code.
